I'm a second-year undergraduate student from the [Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence](https://scai.swjtu.edu.cn/), [Southwest Jiaotong University](https://www.swjtu.edu.cn/).  
My research interests include **superpixel segmentation**, **deep learning-based hyperspectral image reconstruction and quality assessment**, especially in **CASSI-based snapshot compressive sensing systems**, and improvements on **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** for neural networks.

I am very fortunate to be advised by Wang Jianli from the School of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, Southwest Jiaotong University.

You can find my CV here: [Wang Zhizhou's Curriculum Vitae](https://jeffjeno.github.io/ZhiZhou-Wang.github.io/cv/).
